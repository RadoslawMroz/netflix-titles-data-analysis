In this project I answered 4 questions that help understand this dataset.
These questions are:
1) What is the most popular release year for movies on Netflix?
2) What year did netflix add the most content to its platform?
3) What is the most popular month to add new content?
4) What is the movie with the longest title in the dataset?

I made percentage visualization of each answer using matplotlib and seaborn.
I also use pandas to preparate data and answer those questions.
